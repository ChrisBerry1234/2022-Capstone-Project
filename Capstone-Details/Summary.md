The purpose of this project is to implement a temperature tracking system where the heat source would be tracked and eliminated. When the position of the heat source is found, the second servo will be moved to that specific position as well. Attached to the second servo is the fan, depending on the readings from the infrared sensor, the fan will move at a certain speed and eventually begin to cool the specific area. This project basically tracks heat sources and determines to lower the temperature with a fan.
