### How can the project be used in solving a real-life problem?
The level of the temperature in the surrounding area can affects various physical, chemical and biological processes.Â The ability to find the exact area where the temperature is high can be useful to detect issues that can be affecting different systems in industrial applications. The affects of high temperature can affect the business cost of the products, health and safety of the employees. So, being able to search and fine high temperature would be of a great benefit.

### What is a practical application of the project?
A practical application of this project would be to implement it into mechanical systems that heat up quickly, perhaps cars, airplanes and things of that nature. If the temperature is hot in any area, our Temperature Seeking System will be able to find the heat source and eliminate it.
