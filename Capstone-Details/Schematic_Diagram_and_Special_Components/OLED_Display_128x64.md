- SSD1306 model is a mono-color, 0.96-inch display with 128Ã—64 pixels.
  
- It only has four pins and communicates with the Arduino using the I2C communication protocol.

- Unlike an LCD screen display, there is no need for backlight because this display makes its own light. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast.
